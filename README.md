# corn-leaf-analysis

TO PERFORM ---------

1. Please download the plant village dataset available on kaggle. Compressed file will be downloaded with various plant dataset.
2. I have used corn leaf dataset(Contains four sub category). You can use any plant you want.
3. I have manually splitted training and test dataset. (Cut and pasted 10 plants of every sub-category folder to a different folder so that it won't get trained).
4. You will have to run each and every cell from my notebook. (Otherwise error will occur "'model' name not defined")
